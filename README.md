# webpack-babel-typescript-jsx-boilerplate

A minimal boilerplate project that makes using custom jsx in the browser easy.
JSX is implemented via the @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx plugin. 
The behaviour can be changed in runtime/jsx-runtime.ts .
Typescript is supported via @babel/preset-typescript. Meaning no errors outside of your IDE.
public/index.html is the html entry point. It is implemented via "html-webpack-plugin".

Use "npm run serve" to run "webpack-dev-server"
